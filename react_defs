pakage.json - contains all the dependencies, scripts & testing resource required for the project
pakage-lock.json - to ensure proper installation of dependencies
node_modules - where all the dependencies ll be installed suring creating react app
public - a beginner should only be concerned with index.html which ll provide the view
src - index.js - specify root/app component & DOM element which ll be controlled by react
                everything inside root(in index.html) ll be controlled by react

components - all the components ll be stored in a single component, so 5 components in total
2 types - stateless functional component(javascript functions) & 
          stateful class component (class extending component class)
    components describe a part of ui
    they are reusable & nested inside other components

functional components - properties(props) -->java script fns -->HTML (jsx)

class components - it have some internal state which ll be private to that component

jsx  - jsx tags--internally converted into-->React.createElement....hence the need of React import

if i want dynamic content, pass the info between the tags

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_jsx.htm - for more info on jsx

refer to Greet.js to know how to use props in functions
refer Welcome.js to know how to use props in classes

i can specify any no. of properties, react ll bundle all the props together
props are immutable

state  - used to populate with dynamic properties

state is an object that is privately maintained inside a component.
